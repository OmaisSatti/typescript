What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
TypeScript uses compile time type checking.

Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.
